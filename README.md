# DSPD
Student records system implemented in C using list of arrays, linked lists and AVL trees.

It is a menu-driven terminal-based application to perform various operations on student records.

The student record attributes include:
1. Roll Number
2. Subject Code
3. Student Name
4. Marks Obtained

The operations include:
1. Insert/Update entries
2. Delete an entry
3. Get number of active records
4. Check whether list is empty or not
5. Check whether list is fully occupied or not
6. Find topper(s) of a particular subject
7. Insert entries which may contain duplicates
8. Remove duplicate entries
9. Get union of 2 lists
10. Get intersection of 2 lists
11. Get difference of 2 lists
12. Get symmetric difference of 2 lists
13. Display all the entries
14. Clear the whole list

In case of tree, some additional operations include:
1. Search for an entry
2. Find the height of the tree
3. Search for entries in the provided range

The project is implemented using 3 different methods:
1. Arrays, where the student records are stored in lists of arrays
2. Linked Lists, where the student records are stored in the form of a linked list
3. Trees, where the student records are stored in the form of an AVL tree

For Linked List and Tree implementation, an option of populating the records through file is also provided.
